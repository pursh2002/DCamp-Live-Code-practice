#What is Feature Selection ?

Feature selection is also called variable selection or attribute selection.
It is the automatic selection of attributes/features in the data  that are most relevant to the predictive modeling problem you are working on.

#What are your favorite feature selection approaches in Machine Learning?

Firstly I am going to share feature selection approaches which I generally like while building ML/Predictive Models. In next few posts i will explain this techniques in details one by one  - 

- LDA
- ANOVA
- Chi-Square
- Forward Selection
- Backward Selection
- Recursive Feature elimination
- Lasso & Ridge Regression 
- Use Random Forest Variable Importance Matrix
- CORRELATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION
- Information Gain
-T-Test


Packages in R which I use for Feature selection in R - caret , mlbench, boruta !!
