#What is Feature Selection ?

Feature selection is also called variable selection or attribute selection.
It is the automatic selection of attributes/features in the data  that are most relevant to the predictive modeling problem you are working on.

#What are your favorite feature selection approaches in Machine Learning?

Firstly I am going to share feature selection approaches which I generally like while building ML/Predictive Models. In next few posts i will explain this techniques in details one by one  - 

- LDA
- ANOVA
- Chi-Square
- Forward Selection
- Backward Selection
- Recursive Feature elimination
- Lasso & Ridge Regression 
- Use Random Forest Variable Importance Matrix
- CORRELATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION
- Information Gain
-T-Test


Packages in R which I use for Feature selection in R - caret , mlbench, boruta !!

Selection of variables is an important (one of the key) topics in both classical statistics and modern data science. I noticed you often mention stepwise regression in your posts. Stop and learn why it is considered the worst method in statistics for that purpose, then decide. If you feel your knowledge in statistics is not sufficient to decide, just forget this method. 

Professor Frank Harrell (R users recognize this name immediately, for sure) summarizes it on Twitter: 

@f2harrell
"Statistical quote of the day.  Stepwise variable selection has done incredible damage to science.  How did we statisticians let this happen?"

The following few links (more of them are available) highlight the issues well. And, however I don't think we should "hate" the method, like mentioned below, we definitely should be aware of its strong drawbacks.
