This Open Source Bangalore Meetup will focus on a new time-series database technology: TimescaleDB (http://www.timescale.com/).

TimescaleDB is the only open-source time-series database that natively supports Full-SQL at scale. It is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension and correspondingly inherits Postgres' query power, reliability and ease-of-use while scaling to data volumes traditionally reserved for NoSQL systems. TimescaleDB is optimized for fast ingest, complex queries and operational simplicity. In just 10 months, developers have downloaded TimescaleDB over 100,000 times, trusting it for powering mission-critical applications, including industrial data analysis, complex monitoring systems, operational data warehousing, financial risk management, and geospatial asset tracking. TimescaleDB is deployed in industries as varied as manufacturing, utilities, oil & gas, mining, smart spaces, ad tech, finance, telecom, and more.
