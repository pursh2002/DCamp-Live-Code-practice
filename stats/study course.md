Why Statistics?

- It is, with Calculus and Algebra, the core of every Machine and Deep Learning we use for Data Science.
- We need to evaluate and validate our models, make predictions, calculate probabilities and infer possible scenarios, and all of that is possible through Statistics.
- The art of plotting statistical distributions, trends, time series, and make stunning visualizations for the business meetings you'll have to explain your results needs a good statistical base.
