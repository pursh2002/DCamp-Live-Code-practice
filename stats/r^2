*** The Correlation Coefficient: Its Values Lie Within [-1, +1], or Do They?
~ In 1896, the correlation coefficient was invented by Karl Pearson. 
This century-old statistic is still going strong today, second to the mean in the frequency of use. 
~ The correlation coefficient’s weaknesses and warnings of misuse are well-known. 
Based on my consulting experience as a statistical modeler, data miner, and 
instructor of continuing professional studies in statistics for many years,
 I see too often that the weaknesses and warnings go unheeded. 
~ The weakness rarely mentioned is the correlation coefficient interval [–1, +1] 
is restricted by the distributions of the two variables under consideration. 
~ I discuss in my new book, see Comment A, 
1) the effects that the distributions of the two variables have on the correlation coefficient interval, and 
2) to provide a procedure for calculating an adjusted correlation coefficient, 
whose realized correlation coefficient interval is often shorter than the definitional correlation coefficient interval.

*** Data Science: R-squared Misuse ***
~The correlation coefficient, denoted by r, is a measure of the strength of the straight-line or
linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient—by definition—assumes any value
in the closed interval [+1, –1].
~ The value of r squared, called the coefficient of determination, and denoted R-squared, is typically interpreted as
the percent of the variation in one variable explained by the other variable or the percent of variation shared between 
the two variables.
