5 Tools for Transforming Data with Pandas

If you want to become a data scientist, it's critical that you learn how to transform data efficiently. Master the 5 techniques below (links with examples in comments), and you will become a data-shaping wizard that is ready to tackle any dataset.


Reshaping Pandas DataFrames

1. pivot

Creates a pivot table without aggregation. Can handle categorical data. Incredibly useful when you want to transform column data into rows.


2. pivot_table

Generalization of pivot that can take multiple indices and performs aggregation. Great for when you want to pivot but have duplicate values for an index-column pair.


3-4. stack and unstack

Stack pivots a level of the column labels to rows.
Unstack pivots a level of row labels to columns.

Extremely useful when manipulating multi-indexed DataFrames.


5. groupby

Groupby is a flexible method that creates an object that can be used to split a DataFrame into groups based on a column or row label, apply an operation to the groups, and aggregate them back together into a DataFrame.

Very useful when you want information about categorical features.
