How to get started with SQL for Data Science? 

To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL (Structured Query Language). 

That's the language of relational databases. Is very common that you will be in charge of retrieving information from those kind of databases every day, and also write back to them.

And what about NoSQL? Yes that's important too, but right now for most companies is much more important SQL, and you will be tested for SQL too in almost every interview.
