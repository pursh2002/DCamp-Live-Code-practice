Missing data is a major problem for data scientist.

How can you handle it as a data scientist?

You could ignore the missing data, but that would cause major gaps.

Instead, many data scientist will use a technique called imputation.

Imputation refers to using some form of average or replacement value that is based on the data that is currently present.

One of the easiest to apply is average imputation. This requires taking the average of the data set and replacing it with all the missing values.

This can be further specified by category. For instance, perhaps you use the average income per zip code to replace the missing income of people.

However, this can artificially reduce variability.

Regression substitution is another form of imputation that uses regression to estimate the missing values. By relying on the the other data fields, a data scientist can use multiple regression to estimate the value.

These are just two examples of managing missing data.
