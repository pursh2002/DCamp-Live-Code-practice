Testing your models for correlation between features is important to make sure that the effects you see are not out of pure chance. 

-

This is done by using the tests like Pearson's correlation or Spearman's Rank correlation or another test statistic of your choice, to check for the validity of the Null Hypothesis. 

-> If the Null Hypothesis is rejected, that means the relationship between the variables is not by chance, and there's some real dependency there. 

-> If the Null Hypothesis is accepted, it means that the relationship is out of chance. 

Math runs the world, and Machine Learning models.
